                <p>I was once sitting on a cloud, hypnotized by the beauty of my proximity. </p>
                <p>In love with familiarity and comfortable with my projections.</p><br>

                <p>Abruptly, I spun into infinite disarray.<br>I had suddenly fell from my high altitude into a pit of anguish.<br> With only two legs bearing my fall, I was broken.<br> Trying to find the other half of my heart, and the time to heal my bones, I fell deeper into the valley.<br> I stared through the shadow of death and saw only my thoughts shrouded inside darkness.<br> Without light to reveal the way, my vision was captivated by gloom. The murkiness had deluded my sight.</p><br>
                
                <p>Avoiding catastrophe, I griped onto life assiduously.<br>I remembered that to return to elevation, I had to climb this rope through adversity.<br>Despite my shattered physicality and mental malady, to overcome the eerie abyss I recognized it was essential to carry the burden of distress on my back as I blindly held onto the thin string of hope.<br>Hoping I would get pulled back up one day Hoping my addiction to persistence would save me.</p><br>
                
                <p>I waited with perseverance.<br>And eventually a figure of my perceived naive and irrational optimism pulled me up from the depths into the light.<br>I grew here;<br>The buds of my convictions started germination and out bloomed the flowers of my destiny.</p><br>
                
                <p>Knowing I&rsquo;ve seen the worst;<br>Aware that I&rsquo;ve faced the nadir of my sufferings and still constructed a belief which incepted growth, I was no longer frightened by misfortune.<br>Actually, through my fallacies I realized misfortune was fictitious.<br>The definition was truly a figment of my tunneled imagination. The concept was misconstrued.<br>I comprehended that my losses had manufactured an opportunity for winning;<br>I fell from my peak only to climb higher.</p><br>
                
                <p>Now I sit here, on a cloud soaring far above the previous, with my heart finally pieced together, and my bones newly aligned<br>Reminiscing on the treacherous past.<br>Observing the beauty of the distance.<br>Appreciating the pleasures of my calamity.</p>
