                    <p>I was once sitting on a cloud, hypnotized by the beauty of my proximity.<br>
                    In love with familiarity and comfortable with my projections.</p>

                    <p>Abruptly, I spun into infinite disarray.<br>
                    I had suddenly fell from my high altitude into a pit of anguish.<br>
                    With only two legs bearing my fall, I was broken.<br>
                    Trying to find the other half of my heart, and the time to heal my bones, I fell deeper into the valley.<br>
                    I stared through the shadow of death and saw only my thoughts shrouded inside darkness.<br>
                    Without light to reveal the way, my vision was captivated by gloom. The murkiness had deluded my sight.</p>
                    
                    <p>Avoiding catastrophe, I griped onto life assiduously.<br>
                    I remembered that to return to elevation, I had to climb this rope through adversity.<br>
                    Despite my shattered physicality and mental malady, to overcome the eerie abyss I recognized it was essential to carry the burden of distress on my back as I blindly held onto the thin string of hope.<br>
                    Hoping I would get pulled back up one day Hoping my addiction to persistence would save me.</p>
                    
                    <p>I waited with perseverance.<br>
                    And eventually a figure of my perceived naive and irrational optimism pulled me up from the depths into the light.<br>
                    I grew here;<br>
                    The buds of my convictions started germination and out bloomed the flowers of my destiny.</p>
                    
                    <p>Knowing I’ve seen the worst;<br>
                    Aware that I’ve faced the nadir of my sufferings and still constructed a belief which incepted growth, I was no longer frightened by misfortune.<br>
                    Actually, through my fallacies I realized misfortune was fictitious.<br>
                    The definition was truly a figment of my tunneled imagination. The concept was misconstrued.<br>
                    I comprehended that my losses had manufactured an opportunity for winning;<br>
                    I fell from my peak only to climb higher.</p>
                    
                    <p>Now I sit here, on a cloud soaring far above the previous, with my heart finally pieced together, and my bones newly aligned<br>
                    Reminiscing on the treacherous past.<br>
                    Observing the beauty of the distance.<br>
                    Appreciating the pleasures of my calamity.</p>
