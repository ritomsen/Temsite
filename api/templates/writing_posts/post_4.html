                    <p>It’s funny, I wouldn’t think you would step towards fear.<br>
                    Wouldn’t think you would look into, well uncertainty, and look to get near.<br>
                    It wasn’t the gravity that pulled you in;<br>
                    In fact you looked to the warm light of your old star,<br>
                    Hugged the familiarity goodbye and still jumped far.</p>

                    <p>And although initially it led you to unfamiliarity,<br>
                    You embraced it like your best friend.<br>
                    Clutched onto it as if it gleamed luminously,<br>
                    Even though it looked more like a dark end<br>
                    Yet, it showed you that there was more to this journey you knew.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the point of no return, you found the cost deemed from a supernova<br>
                    But now the power of the explosion was in you<br>
                    You used this to adventure the variance;<br>
                    Investigate the doubt;<br>
                    Exchanged your curiosity for precariousness;<br>
                    And after the universe calmed, you found a star brighter.</p>
                    
                    <p>A new system dawned from what once was nothing.<br>
                    A light so radiant it beamed to your past world, and even showed them that you found something.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not only did you step towards fear;<br>
                    You looked into the dark abyss of uncertainty,<br>
                    Heard the wavering enigmatic echoes,<br>
                    Reasoned against your thoughts of ambiguity,<br>
                    And still decided to jump here.</p>
                    
                    <p>So when I see my black hole,<br>
                    I don’t need to think about where I’ve been;<br>
                    I don’t need to contemplate what’s within.<br>
                    As because of you, I know that I’ll figure it all out after I jump in.</p>
