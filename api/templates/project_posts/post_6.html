                            One thing I love to do is say Happy Birthday to people, especially because I know how much I appreciate it when I get a good Happy Birthday text. Additionally, it helps you maintain friendships from people you may have not talked to for a long time. But, I frequently forget birthdays. I don't really like the way gcal does them because it is a grind to load them all on there, and I rarely look at the birthdays on snapchat (even tho it is surprisingly really good for that). So, I decided to create an app that reminds me of my friends birthdays. Introducing Cnct. I built this app using Flutter, and used a lot of the plugins that come with it. I used inpsiration from a flutter app I saw online called Chcklst as inspiration for the UI of the app. Some of the main features include: Importing your birthdays from your contacts, getting notifications on your birthday, being able to press a button and go straight to text message with a prefilled birthday message for that person's contact, insertion and deletion of birthdays, viewing birthdays today, within the next 2 weeks and per month, searching for poeple's birthdays by name. Overall, this was my first complete flutter app and it was fun to learn the framework, dart is like a combination of javascript, python, and c++ which I knew so it was intersting combining them. Additionally, it was really rewarding downloading the app on my phone and actually using what I had created :) Onto the next one.
