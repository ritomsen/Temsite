            <p class="text-zinc-200">
                I played piano since the age of 3. I grew up doing piano competitions and loving the rush of winning trophies. It wasn't until junior year of high school though did I fall in love with the instrument itself; this was a result of me discovering the music of Frédéric Chopin. His music hit a spot in my heart and I couldn't stop learning/playing his songs. Right before I came to college, I wanted to record a studio album of my favorite Chopin Pieces. Here is some of the songs I recorded (they keep getting taken off for copyright somehow!? is my playing that similar!!).
