                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> <span class="text-zinc-400 text-sm text-wrap">This was a project that I created with 3 other teammates at the Mhacks x Google Hackathon. This was my first hackathon and I originally was going to do this solo, but I ended up hitting up a random girl (who seemed very experienced with hackathons) on slack and was able to join their team :). They already had this idea of essentially creating a google docs copilot that helped you use voice chat to link up with AI to edit and enhance your google doc. We used the Google Gemini API to connect to the LLM, and used python to link this with our AppScript, which edited the google doc. The point is that in the future, if we are using all this AR/VR stuff, then we won't be typing all that and would rather be using our voice, so this way we can make edits, fix errors, and create essays on google docs with just our voice. We didn't win anything but I was more than satisfied with my first hackathon experience. I met some super cool people from MSU and had a great time making a cool project.

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> <span class="text-zinc-400 text-sm text-wrap">One thing I love to do is say Happy Birthday to people, especially because I know how much I appreciate it when I get a good Happy Birthday text. Additionally, it helps you maintain friendships from people you may have not talked to for a long time. But, I frequently forget birthdays. I don't really like the way gcal does them because it is a grind to load them all on there, and I rarely look at the birthdays on snapchat (even tho it is surprisingly really good for that). So, I decided to create an app that reminds me of my friends birthdays. Introducing Cnct. I built this app using Flutter, and used a lot of the plugins that come with it. I used inpsiration from a flutter app I saw online called Chcklst as inspiration for the UI of the app. Some of the main features include: Importing your birthdays from your contacts, getting notifications on your birthday, being able to press a button and go straight to text message with a prefilled birthday message for that person's contact, insertion and deletion of birthdays, viewing birthdays today, within the next 2 weeks and per month, searching for poeple's birthdays by name. Overall, this was my first complete flutter app and it was fun to learn the framework, dart is like a combination of javascript, python, and c++ which I knew so it was intersting combining them. Additionally, it was really rewarding downloading the app on my phone and actually using what I had created :) Onto the next one.</span></p>
